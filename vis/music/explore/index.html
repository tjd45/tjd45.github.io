      <h2>Information</h2>
      <p id="day-info">This screen displays a single day of my listening history. </br></br>
        Each bar in the visualisation represents an individual 'song play'. Hovering over the song play 
        will show you the name of the song and the artist.</br></br> 
        The width of the bars represents how long the song was played for. The visualisation is 
        designed to fill the horizontal space. Therefore, the positioning on the x axis does not encode 
        any information - the next song immediately follows, even if there was a gap in reality, and a 
        day with fewer songs played on it will have wider bars.</br></br>
        The height of the bars indicates how popular a song and the artist are in my library. The 
        dark grey <span style="color: darkgrey;"> ■</span> bars show how popular the artist is and the 
        light grey <span style="color: lightgrey;"> ■</span> bars bars how popular the song is.</br></br>
        The visual representation is supposed to be evocative of a sound wave.
      </p>
      <p id="year-info">This screen displays a whole year of my listening history. </br></br>
        Each long line you see is actually a combination of hundreds or thousands of individual song plays.
        These lines continue in a single direction until an artist appears in my library for the first time.
        At this point the direction of the line turns 90° to the left.</br></br>
        Through this visualisation you can see the episodic nature at which I discover and listen to new music,
        often spending long periods of time listening to artists I have already encountered and then 
        testing out the water by listening to multiple new artists in close proximity. </br></br>
        Feel free to explore the animation option and see the path of my music be painted for each year.</br></br> 
        The colours selected for each year are purely an aesthetic decision and the design of this visualisation
        was heavily influenced by Stefanie Posavec's <a href="https://www.stefanieposavec.com/writing-without-words" target="_blank">
          Writing Without Words</a> project and intended to mimic the meandering paths my music listening
          can take.
